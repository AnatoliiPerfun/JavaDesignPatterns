## Null Object Pattern

---
>> In object-oriented computer programming, a null object is an object with
no referenced value or with defined neutral (‘null’) behavior. The null object
design pattern describes the uses of such objects and their behavior (or lack
thereof).

---
>>  *The pattern can implement a “do-nothing” relationship,<br/>
    or it can provide a default behavior when an application encounters a null object instead of a real object.<br/>
    Using this pattern, our core aim is to make a better solution by avoiding a “null objects check” or a
    “null collaborations check” through if blocks.*
