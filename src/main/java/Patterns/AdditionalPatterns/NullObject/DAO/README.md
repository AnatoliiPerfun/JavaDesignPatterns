## Data Access Object

---

* DAO Design Pattern is used to separate the data persistence logic in a separate layer. 
* This way, the service remains completely in the dark about how the low-level operations to access the database are done
* The idea behind MVC pattern is a very clear separation between domain objects which represent real-world entities and the presentation layer we see on the screen. 
* Domain objects should be completely independent and should work without a View layer as well.
