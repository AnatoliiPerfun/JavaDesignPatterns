## Serialization in Java

        Serialization in Java allows us to convert an Object to stream that we can send over the network or save it as file or store in DB for later usage.
        Deserialization is the process of converting Object stream to actual Java Object to be used in our program. 
        Serialization in Java seems very easy to use at first but it comes with some trivial security and 
        integrity issues that we will look in the later part of this article. 
        We will look into following topics in this tutorial.
