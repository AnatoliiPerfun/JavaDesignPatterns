## MVC Design Pattern

---

* MVC stands for Model View Controller. <br/>
* This pattern is used to separate the logic of different layers in a program in independent units.

        The idea behind MVC pattern is a very clear separation between domain objects which represents real-world entities 
         and the presentation layer we see on the screen. 
         Domain objects should be completely independent and should work without a View layer as well.
