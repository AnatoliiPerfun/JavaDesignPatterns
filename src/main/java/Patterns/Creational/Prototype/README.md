## Prototype Pattern

---
* It specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new
  objects by copying this prototype.

      This pattern provides an alternative method for instantiating new objects by copying or 
      cloning an instance of an existing object. Thus, you can avoid the expense of creating a
      new instance using this concept.
---
>The core idea of this pattern is to create an object that is based on another object. This
existing object acts as a template for the new object
