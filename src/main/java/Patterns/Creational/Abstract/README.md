## Abstract Factory Pattern

---

* It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
  specifying their concrete classes.

        An abstract factory is often referred to as a factory of factories. 
        In this pattern, you provide a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. 
        In this process, you do not instantiate a class directly; 
        instead, you instantiate a concrete factory and thereafter create products using the factory.
