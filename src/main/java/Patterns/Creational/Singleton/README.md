---
* It ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

> Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.

> The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.

> Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.

> Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade etc.

> Singleton design pattern is used in core java classes also, for example java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop.
