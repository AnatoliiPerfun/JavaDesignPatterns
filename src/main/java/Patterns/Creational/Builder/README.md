## Builder Pattern

---
> The Builder pattern is useful for creating complex objects that have multiple parts.
The object creation process should be independent of these parts. In addition, you
should be able to use the same construction process to create different representations
of the objects.
* It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same
  construction processes can create different representations.
