## State Design Pattern

* Systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through **Context and State** implementations.

        If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object. 
        Then use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. 
        State design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.
