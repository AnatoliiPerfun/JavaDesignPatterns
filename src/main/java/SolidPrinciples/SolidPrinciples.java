           Singe Responsibility Principle
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A class acts like a container that can hold many things such as data, properties, or methods.
        If you put in too much data or methods that are not related to each other,
        you end up with a bulky class that can create problems in the future.

            Open/Closed Principle
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        According to Robert C. Martin, the Open/Closed Principle is the most important
        principle among all the principles of object-oriented design.
        In the book "Clean Architecture", he says the following:
        The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) was coined in 1988 by Bertrand Meyer.
        It says: A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for
        modification.
        The new proposal uses abstract base classes that use the protocols instead
        of a superclass to allow different implementations.

            Liskov Substitution Principle
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         The Liskov Substitution Principle was initially introduced from the work of Barbara Liskov in 1988.
         The LSP says that you should be able to substitute a parent (or base) type with a subtype.
         It means that in a program segment,
         you can use a derived class instead of its base class without altering the correctness of the program.
