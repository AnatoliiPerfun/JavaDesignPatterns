        Dependency Inversion Principle
----
The DIP covers two important things:
* A high-level concrete class should not depend on a low-level concrete class.<br/>
Instead, both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend upon details.<br/>
Instead, the details should depend upon abstractions
