        Liskov Substitution Principle

---
The Liskov Substitution Principle was initially introduced from the work of Barbara Liskov in 1988.<br/>
The LSP says that you should be able to substitute a parent (or base) type with a subtype.<br/>
It means that in a program segment, you can use a derived class instead of its base class without altering the correctness of the program.
