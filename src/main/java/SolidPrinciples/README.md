---
Robert Cecil Martin is a famous name in the programming world. 
He is an American software engineer and best-selling author and is also known as "Uncle Bob."
He promoted many principles.<br/>
The following is a subset of them:<br/>
• Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)<br/>
• Open/Closed Principle (OCP)<br/>
• Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)<br/>
• Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)<br/>
• Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)<br/>
Taking the first letter of each principle, Michael Feathers introduced the SOLID acronym to remember these names easily.
   
***
The SOLID principles are not rules. 
They are not laws. 
They are not perfect truths. 
They are statements on the order of “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” 
This is a good principle, it is good advice, but it’s not a pure truth, nor is it a rule.<br/>
